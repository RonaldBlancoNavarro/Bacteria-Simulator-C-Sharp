# Bacteria Simulator C#
Project of the Data Structures course, National University of Costa Rica.

The simulator consists of a small ecosystem where different types of bacteria live and develop. This software is made using C#, OOP, threats and the simple graphical interface of Windows Forms.

In this simulation, you can control various environmental factors such as temperature, oxygen, carbon dioxide and humidity. These factors have a direct impact on how bacteria, which can be classified as psychrophilic, mesophilic and thermophilic, grow and behave.

For example, if you increase the temperature, some bacteria may thrive while others may die due to the extreme heat. Similarly, if you adjust oxygen or carbon dioxide levels, some bacteria may multiply rapidly while others may be adversely affected.

The idea is to observe how different types of bacteria react to these environmental changes.

In conclusion, this university project is an interactive simulation that allows you to explore how different types of bacteria behave in a controlled environment, which helps you understand the importance of environmental factors in microbial life.
